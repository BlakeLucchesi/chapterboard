        <h3>Credits</h3>
        <p>ChapterBoard was created and operated by Blake Lucchesi and Alexandra Harris. The logo and iPhone application icons were designed by our good friend Lance Alton Troxel of <a href="http://thisbythem.com">This By Them</a>.</p>
          
        <p>The ChapterBoard web application was built upon the <a href="http://kohanaframework.org/">Kohana PHP MVC Framework</a> (version 2.3.x).  It was hosted on a server running <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/business/server/overview">Ubuntu Linux</a> with the <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/Main">nginx web server</a> and <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL database server</a>.</p>
