the point of ending meeting early is to end meeting early, not to stretch it out longer. meaning that just because the goal is to keep meeting under 2 hours, doesn't mean that you can filibuster until that time is up.  i get that u have stuff to say in your G.O. and yeah we can make jokes and say what we want and shit. but talking for the sake of talking is inconsiderate to those who need to finish homework, or have class in the morning.  you can use the excuse of "time management" but that applies to meeting as well, or you can make the excuse that you have your own stuff to deal with and u get it done, but not everyone has equal amounts of work, or can function on the same amounts of sleep as other people.  

I'm not trying to be a dick or anything. i just want to see the day where we can get in and out of meeting in under an hour.
