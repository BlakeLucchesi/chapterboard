Dear <?= $vars['name'] ?>,

We're contacting you today with some very sad ChapterBoard news.  It is with a heavy heart that we announce the impending closure of ChapterBoard and our services to the Greek community.  This decision was not an easy one to make and did not come lightly to anyone involved, unfortunately it had to be made all the same.

We plan to shut down ChapterBoard.com and all of our services on July 1st, 2012 (we have stopped development on all planned projects).  This will give our chapters ample time to transfer financial information and records and export all your important documents and data.  To ease this process, we have created a data exporter for chapter admins to backup all your chapter's information on ChapterBoard.  To export your chapter's data, login to ChapterBoard, click on "Chapter Account" at the top of the page and then click on "Generate Backup" (please note: only chapter admins can access this tool).

If you collect dues on ChapterBoard, we strongly suggest wrapping up all of your financial collections through spring 2012 and not assessing summer charges to your members as our service will not be available.  If you are looking for another financial collection provider, we recommend speaking with the team at Omega Financial (contact information listed below):

Additionally, we know the ChapterBoard recruitment tools have become integral to many chapters' recruitment efforts.  To continue recruiting amazing new members, we strongly recommend the recruitment experts at Phired Up.  Below is their contact information if you're interested in their services:

Finally, we want to say a very personal "thank you" to each and every ChapterBoard user.  When we created this tool, we had no idea where it would go or how many chapters it would help.  We are beyond happy at the success of ChapterBoard and we feel so lucky to have worked with such a passionate user base.  Thank you for supporting this business, helping us expand our reach, and working with us to create a new way for Greeklife to operate.

We still believe these types of tools should be free for Greeks to use so, when ChapterBoard shuts down, we will be open sourcing our code for anyone and everyone to use (details to come).  If you have a programmer in your chapter or an individual who wants to learn a new skill and make their resume stand out, we strongly encourage you to use our code and build your own ChapterBoard site for your chapter (you can even change the colors if you want).

Thank you for your time in reading this message and if you have any questions about the closure of ChapterBoard, please contact us at Team@ChapterBoard.com.

Best of luck on finals and congratulations to all the 2012 graduating seniors!

- The ChapterBoard Team
