  <h3>If I archive my recruitment lists, can I get them back later?</h3>
  <p>Yes. If you archive your recruitment lists and need them in the future, you can always email us at <a href="mailto:team@chapterboard.com">Team@ChapterBoard.com</a> and we can retrieve this data for you. When we retrieve your recruitment data, we can either repopulate your recruitment lists on ChapterBoard or export the data to an Excel sheet and email it to you.</p>

  <h3>Can new members see the Recruitment section on ChapterBoard?</h3>
  <p>No, new members cannot see the Recruitment section. Once you have your bidded members and finish a round of recruitment, we strongly recommend archiving your Bidded and No Longer Recruiting lists on ChapterBoard. Again, new members on ChapterBoard cannot access the Recruitment section but we still advise archiving these lists to keep your Recruitment section clutter-free and to avoid any accidental issues in the future. When you archive your lists, the data is taken off your ChapterBoard account and stored in our secure chapter archives.</p>

  <h3>Once members are bidded, can I automatically create member accounts from their profiles on ChapterBoard?</h3>
  <p>Unfortunately, no. When members accept their bids and you move them from the Actively Recruiting to the Bidded Members list, you must send them invitations to join you and your chapter on ChapterBoard. This is the one and only way a new member can access your ChapterBoard account. To send invitations, go to the Members section on ChapterBoard and click on “Invite Members”. Be sure to select the Member Type as “New Member”, not “Active”, when sending invitations to new members (because new members are not full-fledged members of your chapter, they have limited access on ChapterBoard).</p>
