  <h3>Can I import my chapter’s Google calendar?</h3>
  <p>Yes, ChapterBoard is happy to do a one time import of your Google calendar to your ChapterBoard account. To do this, please send an email to <a href="mailto:team@chapterboard.com">Team@ChapterBoard.com</a> and include the URL for your calendar’s iCal feed. To find this URL, go to your Google calendar, click on “Calendar Settings” for your chapter’s calendar, and then click on the XML button at the bottom of the page (this should be an orange button). This will open a pop-up window that will contain the URL for your calendar’s iCal feed.</p>
  <p>Additionally, please make sure your chapter’s calendar is public or else ChapterBoard will not be able to access and import your data. To make your calendar public, click on “Share this Calendar” and then select “Make this calendar public”. If you have any questions about this process, please send us an email (<a href="mailto:team@chapterboard.com">Team@ChapterBoard.com</a>).</p>
