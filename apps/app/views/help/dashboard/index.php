  <h3>How do I send a group text message?</h3>
  <p>In order to send a chapter text message you must first be a Text Message admin. Only Text Message admins can send text messages to your chapter; we don’t allow everyone access to this feature so as not to overload your members with thousands of messages. If you are a Text Message admin, you can send a message from either your phone or ChapterBoard.com. To send from your phone, just text your message to (415) 800-3041. If you need to send your message to a specific group on ChapterBoard (actives, new members, seniors, etc.) don’t forget the group tag at the beginning of your message. To view your chapter’s group tags, please go to the Text Message page on ChapterBoard.</p>
  <p>If you want to send a message from ChapterBoard.com, go to the Text Message page and click on “Send Message”. Be mindful of the length of your message (this is a text message after all) and don’t forget to select the groups you want to contact if necessary.</p>

  <h3>How do I pay my dues online? What forms of payment does ChapterBoard accept?</h3>
  <p>To pay your dues online, click on “Pay My Dues” at the top of the Home page and then click “Pay Online”. You can see your outstanding balance and the related charges (what you owe money for), and choose to pay the entire balance or just specific charges.</p>
  <p>You can make a payment on ChapterBoard with your debit or credit card or with a check. Our payment system is completely secure and we do not store any of your payment information. If you have any questions about your payment, please email us at <a href="mailto:team@chapterboard.com">Team@ChapterBoard.com</a> or give us a call at (949) 525-4432.</p>
  <p>Please note, in order to pay your dues online, your chapter must first enable online financial collections. If you do not see the "Pay Online" link your chapter is currently not setup for online collections.  If you have questions about online collections with ChapterBoard please email us at <a href="mailto:team@chapterboard.com">Team@ChapterBoard.com</a></p>

  <h3>I need to send an email to all of my members. Can I do this with ChapterBoard?</h3>
  <p>Yes you can! If you need to send an email to your members you can use either the Private Messaging feature or the Announcement feature if you’re a chapter admin.</p>
  <p>To send a private message on ChapterBoard, click on “Inbox” and then click on “Send Message”. The Private Messaging feature acts as a private discussion between the sender and the recipients. When you send a message, the recipients see the message in their ChapterBoard Inbox and they also receive an email version of the message. When a recipient responds, their reply is sent to everyone included in the message, not just the original sender.</p>
  <p>If you need send an email and receive individual responses from all the recipients, please use the Announcement feature (again, you need to be a chapter admin to access this feature). To send an Announcement click on “Post new announcement”. Your announcement will be posted on the Home page so every member sees it when they login. The announcement will also be sent out to all your members via email. If a member sends a response to your announcement, their reply is only received by the original sender, not by any of the other recipients.</p>
