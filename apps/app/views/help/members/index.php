  <h3>How do I remove members from ChapterBoard?</h3>
  <p>To edit your chapter’s membership you must be a chapter admin. To remove a member from your ChapterBoard account, click on “Manage Members” and then scroll to the individual’s name on the member list. On the right side of the screen is a “Change Member Status” column with separate drop down menus for each individual. To remove a member from ChapterBoard, change the Member Status from “active” to “archived” and the click “Save Changes” at the bottom of the page. The archived individual will no longer have access to your chapter’s ChapterBoard account, they will no longer receive any text messages or email notifications related to your chapter, and they will no longer appear on your chapter’s roster on ChapterBoard.</p>
  <p>We chose to archive rather than delete members so that their previous ChapterBoard activity, like Forum topics, comments, and Calendar events, are still available to you and your chapter. Please note that archiving a member on ChapterBoard should only be used for individuals who are no longer affiliated with the chapter or your Greek organization. For members who have graduated, transferred, or left the chapter but are still in good standing with your organization, please change their status from “active” to “alumni”.</p>

  <h3>What do I do with members who are graduating or transferring?</h3>
  <p>To edit your chapter’s membership, you must be a chapter admin. For graduating or transferring members, you need to change their member status to “alumni” on ChapterBoard. To do this, lick on “Manage Members” and then scroll to the individual’s name on the member list. On the right side of the screen is a “Change Member Status” column with separate drop down menus for each individual. For members who are graduating or transferring, change their Member Status from “active” to “alumni” and the click “Save Changes” at the bottom of the page. This will allow the individual to still access your chapter’s account (alumni have limited access), communicate with other alumni and pay alumni dues, and update their contact information. Using the “alumni” member status on ChapterBoard will also allow your chapter to contact your alumni in the future via email and text messages.</p>
