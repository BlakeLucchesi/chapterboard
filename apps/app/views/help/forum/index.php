  <h3>I voted on a poll but I can’t see the results. Why not?</h3>
  <p>When a poll is created, the creator can choose not to share the results with the chapter’s members. Usually, this option is exercised for sensitive chapter issues or chapter questions that require anonymous answers. For information about a specific poll on ChapterBoard, please contact the creator.</p>
