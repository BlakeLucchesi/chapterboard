      <p>Our Greek clients often ask us for our input on improving their internal collection policies. This memo
      provides our recommendations and ideas on good collection strategies.</p>

      <h3 class="title">Membership Application Form</h3>

      <p>This basic application for membership is very important and will provide very helpful information should
      collection become an issue later.</p>

      <p>In addition to the usual information your chapter needs, the following items are very important should
      you need to use our services in the future.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Parentâ€™s Home Address / Phone Number. This address is much more stable over time.</li>
        <li>Social Security Number (very helpful in terms of identification and location assistance)</li>
        <li>Co-signature or Guarantee. If you can have the parents co-sign or guarantee payment your chances
        for collection in the future are much stronger. For example, when we receive accounts for collection we
        have two parties to pursue for your money rather than the brother or sister alone. That doubles your
        chances for ultimate collection. We recommend you have an attorney prepare this language for your
        application.</li>
        <li>Birth date. This information is helpful for identification purposes should third party collection be
        needed.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3 class="title">Billing / Follow-Up Recommendations</h3>

      <p>Of course, you want to give the brother/sister every opportunity to pay before you take collection
      action. In general terms, we recommend 3-4 monthly billing follow-ups. The last bill should have some
      type of warning that the account is past due and needs to be paid. If the final billing is ignored, we
      recommend you send a letter advising that the account is seriously past due and that the person will
      be turned over for collection if the account is not paid within 30 days.</p>

      <p>Our experience is that once you have made the number of follow-ups outlined without success,
      further pursuit is a waste of time in the majority of cases. After all, what is left to be said? If the brother
      or sister was sincere about paying you, he/she would have already done so, or worked out some
      arrangement to satisfy the obligation.</p>
