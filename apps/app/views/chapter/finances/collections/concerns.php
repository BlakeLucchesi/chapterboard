      <p>The experience of working with fraternities and sororities for 25 years has taught us that
      you sometimes worry about turning your brothers/sisters over for collection. If you have that
      concern, we would like to share some points we have learned from our own experience and
      that of many other Greek clients.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>It is not your fault that you are faced with this decision. If there is fault, it lies with the
      person who has not lived up to his/her commitment to your chapter.</li>

        <li>Is it fair to permit people to avoid taking care of their financial obligation? They
      promised to pay and have enjoyed all the advantages. By not paying, they really
      default not just on their financial obligation, but the obligation of loyalty to their
      fraternity or sorority. By avoiding their promise to pay, they transfer more financial load
      to other brothers/sisters. Is that fair?</li>

        <li>The best way to solve these concerns is to have chapter policies that carefully
      outline the financial rules. One rule may be that all accounts not paid by the end of a
      specified period of time (perhaps the end of the school term) will be turned over for
      collection. By having this policy in writing, and signed by all members, it will eliminate
      any concerns about taking collection action should that event become necessary.
      Accountability will rest where it should, and that is with the offending person. Included
      in a good policy is the outline of a billing follow-up that includes a final warning letter
      and then turnover to collections if payment is not received.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>The Parson-Bishop collection service is professional and business-like. Our entire approach
      to the brother/sister has an educational tone. This tone outlines the importance of taking
      financial responsibility so that personal credit standing will not be impacted. We carefully
      outline the importance of a good credit history since brothers/sisters will soon need credit to
      purchase automobiles and homes and meet other needs. Unless the person is completely
      irresponsible, this approach will work very well for you. We only report to the credit agencies
      when several, business-like follow-ups fail to recover your funds.</p>

      <p>It is a fact that our service will collect money otherwise lost to you forever. Why not collect
      every dollar you can? After all, your chapter can always use the funds.</p>
