      <p>ChapterBoard has partnered with <a href="http://www.parsonbishop.com/" target="_blank">Parson-Bishop</a> to help your chapter collect severely past due accounts. Parson-Bishop has been providing chapters and national offices with debt collection services for well over 30 years.  Their unique approach and pricing model will allow your chapter to collect past due debts without the over priced fees that other debt collectors charge.</p>

      <p>Each new account submitted for collection will be contacted by Parson-Bishop up to four times over a period of approximately 45 days. If they can collect in this phase, your cost is just 18% of the amount collected.  Parson-Bishop collects all moneys and will send your chapter a check less their fee. Note, you will not pay any ChapterBoard fees for amounts collected by Parson-Bishop.</p>

      <p>Some accounts will need more extensive effort in order to collect them. If Phase I does not collect, then the accounts move to Phase II and are assigned to one of Parson-Bishop's staff members for personal one-on-one collection follow-up until the accounts are collected or deemed uncollectible at this time. In general terms, their staff will work with each account in this phase for 60-90 days. Since this is a more personalized follow-up over a longer period of time their fee is 35% of any amount actually collected.</p>

      <h4>Additional Details</h3>
      <p><strong>Monthly Reports:</strong> While accounts are in Phase I you will receive status reports outlining our activity. The reports also act as an acknowledgment so you know your accounts have been received and are in process. Status reports stop on each new submission after three months. Once they are in credit report files there is nothing new to tell you.</p>

      <p><strong>Collection Activity Statement:</strong> As moneys are collected, you will receive a month end CAS detailing the transaction(s) and our check, less our fees, will be attached. This report will become one of your favorites!</p>

      <p><strong>Client Service Center:</strong> If you need assistance just call Parson-Bishop's service center at <span style="white-space: nowrap">(800) 543-0468</span>, their staff is well trained and eager to provide cheerful service.</p>

      <p>Thanks again for the opportunity to work with your chapter and collect money that would
      otherwise be lost to you. Please call if you have any questions or needs.
